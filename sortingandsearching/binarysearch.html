Binary Search



The power of binary search is to divide the search space repeatedly into two halves, and just pick one of them for further searching.

So binary searches are a natural fit to search a sorted space; look at the middle element and decide which half to search.

Unlike a sorted search space, the ability to half the searchspace is sometimes not obvious, but binary searches are a good fit as long as the search space can be repeatedly halved. For example, to find out the square root of a number, the search space is from 1 to the number itself. 

Time complexity

The time complexity of a typical binary search is log n because you repeatedly half a search space of size n. 



Basic Questions



Find a number in a sorted array.



Find the first occurance of a number in a sorted array.



Advanced Questions



Find the integral square root of a number



Find if a number exists in a sorted array that has been rotated. For example, an array  {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}  rotated by two {40, 50, 10, 20, 30}.

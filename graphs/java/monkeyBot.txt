 *  There are 10 poles infinitely long, and there is a fruit at some  distance on one of the 10 poles.  
 
  If you are programming a monkey-bot, how would you go about fetching the fruit. 
  
  The poles are infinitely long, so you will never reach the end of a pole. 
  You cannot hop from pole to pole, but can climb down a pole after climbing a certain distance, and then pick another pole to climb up. 
  
  The method sawFruit() will return true once the monkey-bot touches or passes the fruit.

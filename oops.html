<h1 style="text-align: center;">Object Oriented Design</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many companies (looking at you Amazon) have an entire interview dedicated to object oriented design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key to answering object oriented design questions is to recoginize that object oriented systems communicate in many ways similar to how we humans communicate in real life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be sure to make yourself familiar with basic object oriented design concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and a few design patterns.</p>
<p>The key steps to answer an object oriented design question are</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask clarifying questions, and identify use cases.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Identify major entities and their behaviors</li>
<li>Identify subtypes of these entities and their behaviors</li>
<li>Map the relation b/w these entities (assosciation).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use design patterns to solve common problems, such as Singleton to prevent a class from being instantiated multiple times.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

Linked Lists

 

Linked lists are discrete chunks of memory called nodes tied together as a list. Unlike arrays, we access a node by passing every node from the head step by step because we cannot directly access a particular node.

This unique challenge in accessing nodes forms the basis of various interview questions on linked lists. Familiarity with a handful of popular interview questions is probably the best way to prepare for linked lists.

 

 

Operation

Time Complexity

Read/Modify a particular node

O(n) unless we have the pointer directly to the node

Insert

O(1) to insert. Unless inserted at head, there is an additional O(n) time complexity to traverse the list.

Delete

O(1) to delete. Unless deleted at head, there is an additional O(n) time complexity to traverse the list.

 



 

 

Basic questions

 

Merge two linked lists https://github.com/interviewprep/InterviewQuestions/blob/master/linkedlist/MergeLinkedList.java

 

Detect if two linked lists intersect https://github.com/interviewprep/InterviewQuestions/blob/master/linkedlist/IntersectionLinkedList.java

 

Reverse a linked list

The basic idea behind this question is to replace a pointer from current to next with a pointer from next to current. Of course, you must be careful not to miss the rest of the linked list after next

Detect a cycle in a linked list

The idea behind detecting cycles in linked lists is that if you traverse a linked list with a loop you will never hit the null pointer. To visualize this question, imagine two people, one running and one walking on a track. What would happen if the track was circular?

Convert a linked list 1,2,3,...n-1,n as 1,n,2,n-1,3,n-2………

The second half of the linked list is interspesed in reverse order with the first half.

Advanced questions

 

A linked list is made up of a special type of node. Each special node has a next pointer like any other linked list, but also has a special pointer that points to another  (random) node in that linked list.  How will you clone this linked list?

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Graphs</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of graphs as trees with cycles. &nbsp;Thus, unlike a tree traversal, you need to make sure you are not moving around in cycles.</p>
<p>A few other diffrences are&nbsp;that trees are typically presumed to have only 2 child nodes, while a node in a graph is typically presumed to have n adjacent nodes. Graphs, unlike trees, can be disconnected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Basic Questions</h2>
<p>Find if there is a path between two&nbsp;given nodes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Advanced Questions</h2>
<p>A Knight is at location (0,0) on a chessboard. Find the minimum number of steps needed to reach square (0,3).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Knight is at location (0,0) on a chessboard. Enumerate its path (points in needs to visit in order) to (3, 3), if such a path exists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: The path to (4,2) is (0,0), (2,1), (4,2).</p>
